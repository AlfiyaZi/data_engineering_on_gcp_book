# Chapter 10: Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

Much of a Data Engineer's responsibility is to manage their tools. So far in this book we've discussed Composer, GCS, BigQuery, Cloud Functions, Dataproc, Pub/Sub, and Secret Manager. We've been managing these resources through command line scripts, which is useful learning, but not a good way to handle your production environment. We want to define these resources in text files and have those files in source control. This is called Infrastructure as Code.

Terraform is a tool that allows you to define your infrastructure, and the various permissions to access that infrastructure, in a series of configuration files. Terraform is not owned or managed by Google, but it does work well with GCP.

However, because this is not a GCP service we'll be running Terraform on our local machine.

## Installing Terraform

## Creating Your Configuration Files

## Deploying Your Infrastructure to GCP

## Updating your Infrastructure

## Cleaning Up
